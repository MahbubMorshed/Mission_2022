            <p>A community is a group of individuals striving to accomplish a common goal together. For example, communities of Buddhists look for enlightenment and inner peace within themselves and their bodies. The word “community” reminds one of a positive place to grow and develop. A community supports all people who want to learn more and to work together.</p>
